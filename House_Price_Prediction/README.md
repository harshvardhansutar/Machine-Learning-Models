# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project is part of my ongoing AI/ML journey.  
It is the **first model** I built after completing the Skill4Digital AI/ML course.

## 📌 Problem Statement

**Goal**: Predict the price of a house based on its square footage.

We use **Linear Regression** to model the relationship between house size and price, using a synthetic or real dataset with just two columns:
- `SquareFootage`
- `Price`

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Loading and exploring datasets with Pandas
- Visualizing data distributions and relationships using Matplotlib
- Splitting data into training and testing sets
- Fitting and evaluating a linear regression model
- Using Mean Squared Error (MSE) for model accuracy

## 📊 Output Visualization

The blue dots represent the actual house prices from the test set, while the red line shows the predicted prices from the regression model.
