# 🧠 Machine Learning Models

Welcome to my Machine Learning Models repository! This repository showcases my journey in learning and applying various machine learning algorithms and techniques.

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each model is stored in its own folder and contains:
- `model.py` – Python file with the implementation.
- `dataset.csv` – The dataset used for training/testing.
- `README.md` – Brief description of the model (optional per folder).

## 📌 Included Models
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- K-Means Clustering
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Neural Networks (coming soon...)
