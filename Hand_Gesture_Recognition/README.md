🧠 Project Title:
"GestureAI: Real-Time Hand Gesture Recognition for Human-Computer Interaction"

🎯 Objective:
To develop a hand gesture recognition system that can accurately identify and classify different hand gestures from image or live video feed, enabling gesture-based control for smart devices, applications, and AR/VR systems.

🧩 Key Features:
Detects hand from image or live webcam feed

Classifies predefined gestures (e.g., thumbs up, stop, okay, victory ✌️, etc.)

Real-time frame-by-frame prediction

UI for live gesture detection (optional)

Optionally integrated with system control actions (volume up/down, etc.)
